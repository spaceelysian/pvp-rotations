# To be used with [RotationSolverReborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn)

For Manual Mode! 

These are basic. Use Conditionals under Actions tab to optimize any rotation. 

Pro-tip! Go to Actions -> GCD-Friendly and uncheck Standard-issue Elixir, then under oGCD-attack uncheck Guard. It's better to not waste these abilities randomly.
